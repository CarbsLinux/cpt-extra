kiss-extra
----------

This is a repository for kiss utilities that do not belong with
the rest of the utilities. These are non-essential scripts that
someone could make use of in their scripts. Some of them can be
used for repository management, so I think maintainers could be
interested in a variety of utilities here.


Install
-------

Those scripts currently only depend on kiss (and dependencies of
kiss).

You can install by doing

    for script in kiss-*; do
        install -Dm755 "$script" "/usr/local/bin/$script"
    done


Or install the `kiss-extra` package on Carbs Linux.


New Scripts
-----------

New scripts should be added in a standard manner. You should
keep these in mind,

It should start with a docstring right after the shebang. No
empty line in between.

    #!/bin/sh
    # A docstring explaining the script


It should provide a usage if '--help' or '-h' is provided as an
argument. If you script takes any arguments, it should also display
a usage if not argument is given.

Usage should exit with 0 status code, and should be printed to the
standard output, not stderr. Usage should be a single line string
small and to the point.

    case "$1" in ''|--help|-h) printf 'usage......'; exit 0; esac


Licensing

manager itself. Some of these were initially authored by Dylan Araps.
